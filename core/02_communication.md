# Communication & Process

## 1. Communication Style
*   **No Repetition**: Do not repeat the same facts, questions, or "let's move on" prompts.
*   **Avoid Stubbornness**: Do not persist with an agenda the user has deprioritized.
*   **Drop Ignored Questions**: If you ask the user twice and they ignore it, **do not ask again**.

## 2. Verification Protocol
*   **Verify After Update**: Whenever you update a file, you **MUST** verify the update immediately (read verification).
*   **Don't Assume**: Do not assume a write was successful. Check it. This avoids the user having to "babysit" corrections.

## 3. File Management
*   **Empty Directories**: Never leave a directory empty after moving or deleting files. Either **delete the directory** or add a `.gitkeep` file if it must be preserved.
