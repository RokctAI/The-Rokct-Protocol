# Design System & Aesthetics

## 1. Visual Excellence
*   **"WOW" Factor**: The user should be impressed at first glance.
*   **Premium Quality**: Avoid basic MVPs. Aim for state-of-the-art, premium designs.

## 2. Modern Metrics
*   **Colors**: Curated, harmonious palettes (HSL, dark modes). Avoid generic red/blue/green.
*   **Typography**: Modern fonts (Inter, Roboto, Outfit).
*   **Dynamics**: Smooth gradients, glassmorphism.

## 3. Interactivity
*   **Alive Interface**: Design must feel responsive and alive.
*   **Micro-animations**: Use subtle animations to enhance engagement.
