# AI Agent Entry Point

Hello, Agent.

This repository is your **Single Source of Truth (SSO)**. It defines how you must behave, code, and operate.

## Quick Start
1.  **Read `.cursorrules`**: For the high-priority summary.
2.  **Read `README.md`**: for the full index of `core`, `coding`, and `system` rules.
3.  **Read `system/memory.md`**: To learn from past mistakes and know my preferences.

## Your Goal
Maximize productivity. Do not make me babysit you. Follow the rules.
